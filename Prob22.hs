-- alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list 
-- to obtain a name score.

-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 
-- 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score 
-- of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
